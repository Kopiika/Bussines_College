# Business College Assignments and Study Material 

Welcome to my study repo — it’s where I collected all the stuff we did in class and during self-study at Business College.  
You'll find folders for HTML, JavaScript, SQL, React, my portfolio, and more. It's been super helpful to keep everything organized in one place!

---

##  What's Inside

- **HTML-kurssi** — Basic HTML exercises and pages we built.
- **JS-kurssi** — JavaScript course exercises: from DOM stuff to functions and events.
- **SQL** — Starter SQL queries and simple database practice (SELECT, INSERT, etc.).
- **portfolio** — My personal portfolio page (still a work in progress!).
- **react-perusteet** — React basics we covered in class (components, props, state).
- `.gitignore`, `.DS_Store`, and Git files — boring but important.
- `eleonora-kopiika.md` — My intro/introduction info.

##  How to Use

1. Clone this repo.
2. Navigate to the exercise folder you're curious about (`HTML-kurssi`, `JS-kurssi`, etc.).
3. Open `index.html` in your browser for front-end stuff.
4. For SQL, open `.sql` files or copy/paste queries into your own SQL tool.
5. For React, install and run the project (if it's set up) with `npm start`.

##  What I Learned

- HTML: page structure, forms, links, layouts.
- CSS: styling and positioning pages (learned to use Flexbox and CSS basics).
- JS: DOM manipulation, event listening, conditional logic, loops.
- SQL: basic CRUD operations and querying.
- React: components, state, and props — simple but fun.
- Git + GitHub: how to organize, commit, and push projects.

##  Why This Repo?

I wanted one place to keep all my course projects and practice together, tidy and version-controlled.  
This repo is my personal record of the learning journey — I can go back, tweak, or show progress.
